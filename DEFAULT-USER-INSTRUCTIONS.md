# ðŸŽ­ Default User Instructions - Prank Chat App

## How the Prank Works

This app appears to be an AI chatbot to regular users, but **all their messages actually go to you** (the default user). You can then respond as if you're an AI, creating a hilarious prank experience!

## Getting Started

### 1. Access Your Dashboard
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/default-user.html` (or your deployed URL)

### 2. What You'll See
- **Left Panel**: All incoming messages from users who think they're chatting with AI
- **Right Panel**: Chat history and response interface

### 3. How to Respond
1. Click on any message in the left panel to view the full conversation
2. Type your response in the text area (pretend to be an AI!)
3. Click "ðŸ¤– Send as AI" to send your response
4. The user will see your message as if it came from an AI

## Tips for a Great Prank

### ðŸ¤– Act Like an AI
- Use phrases like "As an AI, I..." or "Based on my analysis..."

### ðŸŽ¯ Response Ideas

- **Quirky AI**: "That's fascinating! As an AI, I find human behavior quite intriguing..."
